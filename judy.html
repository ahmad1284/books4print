    <h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Thank you for joining my workshop on Client Magnet Habits. Before we dive in, let me share what you can expect to
        learn today. We'll cover realistic expectations about getting clients, developing the right mindset for
        handling rejection, making productive work a habit, and reducing the mental resistance that comes with daily
        tasks. All of this will lead to 100 productive days that will help you land clients.</p>
    <h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>I'm Judy, a 17-year-old copywriter and growth operator based in Belgium. I started this journey in 2022 when
        I was 15, at a time when my family was struggling financially and I needed to find a way to help my mom.</p>
    <h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">My Journey: From Gaming to Growth Operating</h1>
    <p>Here's something funny - a few months before I started copywriting, I began seeing Andrew Tate on my For You
        page. Even my mom started sending me his videos, saying "Look, this man, what he's saying, he's
        right." For me, it was life-changing advice because until then, I'd never heard anything different. All
        I knew was school - I didn't even have big goals in life.</p>
    <p>When I heard what he had to say, it was so different that I needed to hear more. I fell into this rabbit hole of
        online business and making money online. Instead of just watching motivational videos, I decided to take action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="3-1-my-first-success">3.1. My First Success</h2>
    <p>I started with short-form video editing when YouTube Shorts were really taking off. A few weeks later, I got my
        first client and started earning $50 per week. This was crucial because it proved to me that making money online
        was real. Let me tell you - even if you make just one cent online, that proof is powerful. It shows you it's
        possible, and once you know it's possible, you'll succeed even faster.</p>
    <h2 id="3-2-the-turning-point">3.2. The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>During the FIFA World Cup, I had a realization that changed everything. I saw how much money was flowing into
        something that wasn't even life-changing - just entertainment. I thought to myself, "If there's so
        much money being spent on this, why can't I have at least a fraction of it?" That's when I decided
        to invest in my first copywriting course.</p>
    <h2 id="3-3-my-daily-routine">3.3. My Daily Routine</h2>
    <p>I developed what some might call an intense schedule, but it worked for me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wake up at 4 or 5 AM</li>
        <li>Practice copywriting</li>
        <li>Reach out to 50 prospects</li>
        <li>Attend school full-time</li>
        <li>Work from 5 to 9 PM</li>
        <li>Repeat every single day</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let me be clear - I wouldn't have been able to do any of this if I hadn't fixed my mindset first. You
        see, before all this, I was obsessed with video games - Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Fortnite, League, you name
        it. I had no goals, my grades were bad, and I wasn't doing my homework. I'm not saying I've made
        some incredible transformation, but considering where I started, it's pretty significant.</p>
    <h1 id="ch4" class="chapter">The Truth About Productivity</h1>
    <p>Here's something important - I achieved all of this without ever having to meditate or take cold showers. You
        won't hear me talking about a 13-step morning routine because, honestly, that's just unnecessary. If
        you've tried those elaborate morning routines for productivity, you probably already know they don't
        work. They're just a waste of time.</p>
    <p>I did all of this without coaching or mentorship, just through continuous experimenting and experience. What
        I'm about to share with you has a 100% success rate - but only if you do it consistently.</p>
    <p>Quick disclaimer: You might be disappointed by how simple this stuff is. There's no magic involved - I'm
        not a wizard. You might even hear things you already know, and your brain will start making excuses. But today,
        we're going to remove those excuses and get straight to work.</p>
    <h1 id="ch5" class="chapter">Why You're Struggling to Make Progress</h1>
    <p>Let's talk about why you started copywriting in the first place. Maybe it was to make extra money, help your
        family, quit your 9-to-5, or become rich. Whatever your reason, you have to take it seriously. If you don't
        take yourself seriously, you'll end up procrastinating.</p>
    <p>Here's the missing piece that nobody talks about: You need to keep your "why" as relevant as
        possible. Not just as one of your top priorities - but as THE top priority. I want you to think about your goals
        24/7.</p>
    <h2 id="5-1-the-power-of-productive-thoughts">5.1. The Power of Productive Thoughts</h2>
    <p>When you're washing dishes, showering, or doing laundry, you have random thoughts because you have nothing
        else to think about. I want you to use these moments for productive thoughts. Here's what I've noticed
        from my personal research: whenever I'm in a rut, I don't have any thoughts about productivity or my
        goals. But when I'm on a productivity streak, all I think about is work, my goals, how I can improve, what
        content I can create - and that leads to even more productivity.</p>
    <h2 id="5-2-fixing-your-thought-cycle">5.2. Fixing Your Thought Cycle</h2>
    <p>If you're in a rut, the first thing to do is change your thought cycle. You need to think like someone who is
        productive all the time. Only consume content related to your goals. I promise this will automatically lead to
        productivity.</p>
    <h2 id="5-3-setting-realistic-expectations">5.3. Setting Realistic Expectations</h2>
    <p>You won't become ultra-productive after one day. You won't get a client after one day. If it was that
        easy, everyone would do it. Here's what you should actually expect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll fall into ruts occasionally - it happens to everyone, even for just a day</li>
        <li>You'll fail to achieve some short-term goals</li>
        <li>You might get unwanted results despite your efforts</li>
        <li>You might go without sales or clients for a while</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But once you do get a client, you'll finally know what works. The key is to keep going.</p>
    <h1 id="ch6" class="chapter">Making Productivity a Habit: My System That Works</h1>
    <h2 id="6-1-the-power-of-habit-tracking">6.1. The Power of Habit Tracking</h2>
    <p>Let me share something that changed everything for me - habit tracking. But here's the twist: you need to
        compare yourself to yourself. Every week, track your habits and compare them to last week. If you've been
        more productive this week than last week, that's progress. It's like leveling up in a video game.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say you're tracking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing copy (checkmark)</li>
        <li>Doing outreach (checkmark)</li>
        <li>Creating content (checkmark)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you don't complete Thursday and Wednesday this week, but last week you missed Monday, Tuesday, and
        Wednesday - guess what? You've still made progress because you did four more tasks than last week.</p>
    <h2 id="6-2-my-daily-to-do-list-system">6.2. My Daily To-Do List System</h2>
    <p>I carry a small notebook everywhere I go. Before going to sleep, I write my to-do list for the next day. This
        gives me a blueprint when I wake up. Here's why this is crucial: you cannot leave room for boredom or
        excuses - that's the ultimate way to fall into a rut.</p>
    <p>If you finish all your tasks and feel bored, at least read a book or do something productive related to your
        goals. Don't slow down - the more you slow down, the more you delay achieving your goals.</p>
    <h2 id="6-3-the-eat-the-frog-method">6.3. The "Eat the Frog" Method</h2>
    <p>Get to work as soon as you wake up. That's why I woke up at 4 or 5 AM. I knew that if I didn't do the
        work then, I'd never find time later in the day. Even if you just wake up an hour earlier than usual, get to
        work immediately. Trust me, it doesn't feel as hard as trying to work after coming back from school or your
        job.</p>
    <h2 id="6-4-time-blocking-for-success">6.4. Time Blocking for Success</h2>
    <p>Add timestamps to each task. You can use Google Calendar for this. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Morning: Copywriting</li>
        <li>After 10 AM: Outreach</li>
        <li>Afternoon: Content creation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if you don't follow these timestamps exactly, repeat the pattern every day and adjust based on what
        works best for you. Eventually, it becomes imprinted in your mind - you'll know that at 10, you need to
        start outreach. At 9, you need to do prospecting. It becomes automatic.</p>
    <h2 id="6-5-the-one-step-at-a-time-method">6.5. The "One Step at a Time" Method</h2>
    <p>Sometimes starting a task is harder than doing the actual task. Here's my method for removing that mental
        pain:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Simplify your tasks as much as possible<ul>
                <li>Outreach? It's just talking to people</li>
                <li>Writing an email? It's just clicking buttons</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare without pressure<ul>
                <li>Just open your laptop </li>
                <li>Pull up your prospect list</li>
                <li>You don't have to do anything yet</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Take tiny steps<ul>
                <li>"Maybe I'll just send one message"</li>
                <li>"Okay, maybe one more"</li>
                <li>"Five messages isn't so bad"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="ch7" class="chapter">The Reality of Getting Clients: My Proven Approach</h1>
    <h2 id="7-1-the-simple-but-effective-system">7.1. The Simple but Effective System</h2>
    <p>Let me be completely honest - there's no magic formula here. The system I use is straightforward, but it
        works. Here's what I do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prospecting <ul>
                <li>I keep a Google Sheet with potential clients</li>
                <li>Store their profile links or emails</li>
                <li>Dedicate two days per week just for prospecting</li>
                <li>Track everything on a tracking sheet (this is crucial)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Non-Negotiable Outreach <ul>
                <li>50 outreaches per day, minimum</li>
                <li>No excuses - even if I'm sick</li>
                <li>This isn't optional - it's the foundation of success</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Track Everything <ul>
                <li>Record all responses</li>
                <li>Document results</li>
                <li>Use this data to improve your approach</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="7-2-my-instagram-outreach-method">7.2. My Instagram Outreach Method</h2>
    <p>Here's my specific approach that's worked consistently:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Opener Message<br> Instead of sending a block of text, I start with a simple question about their
            product. For example:<ul>
                <li>"Are you still taking coaching clients?"</li>
                <li>Keep it short and relevant to their business
                    This gets me about a 90% response rate. Why? Because it's easy to answer and directly related to
                    their business.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Follow-Up<br> After they respond, I continue with something like:<br> "What if I can get you 50
            more coaching applicants in three months, free of charge? I don't get paid unless you get results."
            Yes, I often get ghosted after this, but some people respond politely, and occasionally, someone says yes.
            That's all you need - one yes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="7-3-multi-channel-approach">7.3. Multi-Channel Approach</h2>
    <p>I don't just stick to Instagram. I reach out to the same prospects through email too:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instagram for conversation-based outreach</li>
        <li>Email for straightforward pitches</li>
        <li>This doubles your chances of getting noticed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="7-4-handling-rejection">7.4. Handling Rejection</h2>
    <p>Let me be real with you - I've been told to F off, been blocked, been told my profile looks horrible, that my
        outreach is terrible, and that my voice notes are awful. But here's the key: Don't take it personally.</p>
    <p>The worst thing you can do in outreach is bring emotion into it. Think from the prospect's perspective:</p>

    <h2 id="7-5-the-next-mentality">7.5. The "Next" Mentality</h2>
    <p>Here's my secret for handling rejection: the "Next" mentality.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Someone doesn't reply? Next.</li>
        <li>Someone rejects you? Next.</li>
        <li>You will never run out of prospects</li>
        <li>There are millions of businesses worldwide ready to give you money</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="7-6-building-credibility">7.6. Building Credibility</h2>
    <p>Even without extensive experience, you can build credibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're in a paid community like CopySkills, mention it</li>
        <li>Talk about your education and investment in yourself</li>
        <li>Use any past results, even small ones</li>
        <li>Show that you're serious about your craft</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember this: all it takes is one 'yes' to change everything. You're not just looking for any client
        - you're looking for the right client who can help you grow.</p>

    <h2 id="8-1-why-100-days">8.1. Why 100 Days?</h2>
    <p>Let me tell you why I chose 100 days. It's long enough to see real results but short enough to stay focused.
        Plus, if you start now, imagine where you'll be in just over three months. Most people overestimate what
        they can do in a day but underestimate what they can achieve in 100 days.</p>

    <h2 id="8-7-final-words">8.7. Final Words</h2>
    <p>Remember this: The difference between success and failure isn't talent or luck - it's consistency and
        persistence. You don't need to be the best copywriter in the world. You just need to be good enough to help
        businesses grow.</p>
    <h1 id="ch9" class="chapter">Common Questions & Real Answers</h1>
    <h2 id="9-1-what-if-im-not-good-enough-yet">9.1. What if I'm not good enough yet?</h2>
    <p>Look, when I started, I wasn't "good enough" either. But here's the truth - you get better by
        doing the work. Start with smaller businesses who need basic copy. As you improve, you can take on bigger
        clients. Remember, I started at 15 with zero experience. If I could do it, you can too.</p>
    <h2 id="9-2-how-do-i-handle-rejection-and-ghosting">9.2. How do I handle rejection and ghosting?</h2>
    <p>I get it - rejection hurts. But here's how I reframe it: Every "no" is one step closer to a
        "yes." Think of it like a video game - you need to defeat small enemies to reach the boss. Each
        rejection is just leveling up your resilience.</p>
    <h2 id="9-3-what-if-i-cant-wake-up-early">9.3. What if I can't wake up early?</h2>
    <p>Then don't. Seriously. The early morning routine works for me, but maybe you're more productive at night.
        The key isn't the time - it's the consistency. Pick hours that work for you and stick to them.</p>
    <h2 id="9-4-how-much-should-i-charge-as-a-beginner">9.4. How much should I charge as a beginner?</h2>
    <p>When I started, I charged $50 per email. Was it low? Yes. But it got me started. Once I had results, I increased
        my rates. Start where you're comfortable, get results, then raise your prices. The key is to start
        somewhere.</p>
    <h2 id="9-5-what-if-i-dont-have-time">9.5. What if I don't have time?</h2>
    <p>I went to school full-time while doing this. Yes, it was hard. But ask yourself - how badly do you want this?
        Find pockets of time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>During lunch breaks</li>
        <li>On the commute</li>
        <li>Between classes</li>
        <li>Early morning/late night</li>
        <li>Weekends</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="9-6-how-do-i-deal-with-imposter-syndrome">9.6. How do I deal with imposter syndrome?</h2>
    <p>I still deal with this! But here's what helps me: Focus on solving problems. When you're genuinely trying
        to help businesses grow, imposter syndrome fades. You're not pretending to be something - you're just
        helping people.</p>
    <h2 id="9-7-what-if-my-english-isnt-perfect">9.7. What if my English isn't perfect?</h2>
    <p>Neither is mine! I'm from Belgium, remember? Good copy isn't about perfect grammar - it's about
        connecting with people and driving results. Some of my best-performing emails had grammar mistakes.</p>
    <h2 id="9-8-how-long-until-i-get-my-first-client">9.8. How long until I get my first client?</h2>
    <p>It took me 3 weeks of consistent outreach. For some people, it's faster; for others, slower. The timeline
        doesn't matter - your persistence does. Keep improving, keep reaching out, and it will happen.</p>
    <h2 id="9-9-what-if-i-fail">9.9. What if I fail?</h2>
    <p>Let me reframe this: The only real failure is giving up. Everything else is learning. I've "failed"
        countless times, but each failure taught me something valuable.</p>
    <h2 id="9-10-final-advice">9.10. Final Advice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start today, not tomorrow</li>
        <li>Focus on helping businesses, not on your fears</li>
        <li>Track everything</li>
        <li>Stay consistent</li>
        <li>Keep learning</li>
        <li>Don't compare yourself to others</li>
        <li>Take action, even if it's imperfect</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember why you started this journey. Whether it's to help your family like I did, to gain financial
        freedom, or to build a career you love - keep that reason in front of you every day.</p>
    <p>Are you ready to start your 100 days? Because if you follow this system consistently, I promise you'll see
        results. They might not come as quickly as you want, but they will come.</p>
